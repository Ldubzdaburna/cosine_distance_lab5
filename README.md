# Cosine Distance Lab 5

## Overview

This project computes the **cosine distance** between all pairs of vectors stored in a file. Cosine distance is a measure of dissimilarity between two vectors, defined as:

The program reads vectors from a file, computes pairwise cosine distances, and outputs the results in ascending order of distance (closest vectors first).
Cosine Distance = 1 - Cosine Similarity
